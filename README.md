## Repository Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory with the following structure:
  - `README.md`: Detailed project description, objectives, methodology, and results.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model development.
  - `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `data/`: Datasets used in the project (if publicly available).
  - `results/`: Outputs of analyses and models, such as graphs, reports, and predictions.
